What is the effective way to monitor those metrics? what about alerts?<br>In this talk we will explore a simple browser - server - database application with regard to monitoring.

From Ops monitoring, APM, forensics to security monitoring and business intelligence.<br><br>In the hands-on part we will train attendees on how to get started with ELK by shipping, parsing, and analyzing log data and then visualizing the events to understand them. As part of the hands-on session, we will learn how to leverage ELK to monitor system and application performance using dockerized, collectd/collectl containers.<br><br>To get the best learning experience, attendees should bring their own laptop, have access to a machine that generates logs and be ready to run the hands-on exercises with us.</p></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="three columns"><span class="time entry">16:00 - 16:30</span>
