In this talk, I’ll focus on the monitoring space which is, in principle, a derivative of the infrastructure realm, and how we manage and maintain our monitoring by utilizing infrastructure as code, as opposed to common concepts of managing monitoring manually, detached from the code in which we want to monitor. I’ll show that by leveraging this concept, we gain easier and better day-to-day maintenance, higher flexibility, more efficient and methodical review processes and a perfect compatibility between the monitoring system and the product it monitors.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="three columns"><span class="time entry">10:10 - 10:30</span>

Due to a whole bunch of external factors such as connectivity and stability of third-party systems, our pass rate was consistently lowered, until 70% became the average pass rate. We knew that this was almost as bad as a coin toss, and decided to dig deeper & solve this technical debt from the source, once and for all. By investigating the logs using log analysis tools to detect patterns in the failed and passing tests, we were then able to build dashboards to help track the trends. Based on these we went to work building a smarter framework for exception classification, that enabled us to create the right tools that ultimately helped us to increase our quality gate to 98%, with a much more detailed view of every test run and easy debugging of external issues. This talk will walk you through this use case from the problem, through the final implementation, and how to think about solving similar problems in your systems.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="three columns"><span class="time entry">12:05 - 12:25</span>

However, successfully integrating it into one's environment is not as easy as it sounds and many hit a brick wall when the simple “Getting Started” instructions fail them and their traces break mid-flow.
In this talk, I’ll explain about context propagation, a key concept in Distributed Tracing, why it can be tricky to implement and give some real-world examples of how it can be achieved. I Hope you’ll be able to easily identify where context breaks in your system and encourage you to get creative with propagating context, so that you can, too, benefit from the advantages distributed tracing offers.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="three columns"><span class="time entry">12:25 - 13:25</span>

If not, they’ll lose track of what brings value to their customers and they will eventually lose their attention and their trust. In this talk, I’ll present how monitoring feature usage can be tricky, require resources, collaboration and creativity, but will eventually bring the CSMs to the next level as professional advisors, and benefit both the company and the customer. Most of all, monitoring product usage this way will show if the value is indeed being delivered as intended.

This new method allows you to improve assertion capabilities by leveraging traces data and making it accessible while setting your expectations from a test. We will introduce you to a new open-source called Malabi - a Javascript framework based on OpenTelemetry that allows you to easily use trace data to take your assertion capabilities to the next level.

He has made it a focus of his career to solve complex programming problems, both as a consultant and entrepreneur. In 2014 he joined the CTO office of a fast-moving cloud security startup, which later was acquired by a networking giant. At this startup he also met Ori Keren and Dan Lines, now co-founders of LinearB. He joined them shortly after the company was established, in order to get back to what he loves most about engineering, solving big challenges, and this time he is focusing on the world of dev team metrics and software delivery management.</p></div><div class="comment-box row"><h3>Summary</h3><p class=description>IT IS possible to run a highly data-driven organization without without killing your culture. In this talk I will share 17 team-based metrics you can use to accelerate delivery, remove process friction, and maintain positive team culture. I'll describe how we were able to cut the cycle time down by 38% by embedding data into our day-to-day practices.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="three columns"><span class="time entry">15:10 - 15:20</span>

With a distributed microservice architecture debugging becomes much harder. Especially across language & machine boundaries. APMs & logs provide the first steps. But in these crucial moments we need something more. Production bugs are the WORST bugs. They got through unit tests, integration, QA & staging...  We cross our fingers, put on the Sherlock Holmes hat & hope the bug made it into the log... If not our only remedy is more logging. That bogs performance for everyone & makes logs damn near unreadable. We have no choice other than crossing our fingers & going through CI/CD again... again... again... With developer observability we can follow a specific process through several different microservices and “step into” as if we were using a local debugger without interrupting the server flow. In this session I will demonstrate such an approach and how everything integrates with common production frameworks.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="three columns"><span class="time entry">15:20 - 15:25</span>

Who can that be??? Oh no, you’re on-call this week! Sounds familiar? Production on call duties can be very stressful, but it doesn't have to be this way. Our on-call duty used to be a disaster, with many alerts and a feeling everything is constantly on fire. In this talk I will share what we did to make it peaceful again, I will show practical steps that worked and didn’t work, and share what I think the secret is for a peaceful production maintenance. I will also introduce internal tools we created to help us understand and analyze the alerts better. I will cover alert fatigue, service ownership, finding root cause, service maintenance so that you can improve your on-call and sleep well at night.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="three columns"><span class="time entry">15:25 - 15:30</span>

But sometimes we are missing some metrics. What happens if I’ll tell that you can create only one metrics to each server? is it possible? how would you create it? Let’s talk about the Golden metrics and why it is a good idea. After many times that our one of our servers stopped working and none of our monitors catch it, we decided to try a new approach. We call it the “Golden Metrics”. Now each service can have one (yes ONE!) metrics that tell us if it is working or now. In this talk I would like to go over a “real world example” of one of our services and talk about the monitors that we had and what did we miss. How the golden metrics approach change the way that we write and talk about our metrics.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sponsors container" id=sponsors><h2>Sponsors</h2><div class=sponsor><a href=https://www.moovingon.com/ target=_blank><img src=/images/sponsors-moovingon.png alt=MoovingOn></a></div><div class=sponsor><a href=https://www.jit.io/ target=_blank><img src=/images/sponsors-jit.png alt=Jit></a></div><div class=sponsor><a href=https://komodor.com/ target=_blank><img src=/images/sponsors-komodor.png alt=Komodor></a></div><div class=sponsor><a href=https://www.wix.com/ target=_blank><img src=/images/sponsors-wix.png alt=Wix></a></div><div class=sponsor><a href=https://lumigo.io/ target=_blank><img src=/images/sponsors-lumigo.png alt=Lumigo></a></div><div class=sponsor><a href=https://www.riskified.com/ target=_blank><img src=/images/sponsors-riskified.png alt=Riskified></a></div></div><div class="committee container" id=committee><h2>Organizing Committee</h2><div class="row container"><p class=description>This conference is a community effort by and for people who do monitoring daily and care about monitoring.
